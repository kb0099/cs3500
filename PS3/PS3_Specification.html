<h2>Problem Set 3 - A Formula Class</h2>
<p class="synopsis">For this assignment you will be creating a Formula class which is a more generalized version of your FormulaEvaluator work. This formula class will be utilized in the upcoming spreadsheet assignment. In PS1, the evaluate function stood alone: it was only used once, returned a result, and then it's "life was over". In a spreadsheet the formula in a given cell will be used over and over again, as many times as the dependent cells are modified. Thus a Formula object must store the expression to evaluate (e.g., "1+2") along with any other needed information (e.g., dependencies), and can then be used to "re-evaluate" the expression whenever necessary (e.g., when other cells get changed). (Note: the result of this assignment is still not a spreadsheet, i.e., your formula class is <b>not</b> responsible for keeping track of modifications to other cells, that will be a future assignment.)</p>
</div>
<div id="topics_body">
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>Your starting point will be the PS3Skeleton solution that you will find in the class repository. It contains a partially implemented project called Formula. It is a generalization of the infix expression evaluator that you created for PS 1. You are to create a solution called PS3 and complete the implementation of the Formula project. <b>You are not allowed to modify any of its public declarations, but can, of course, add private data and helper methods.</b></p>
<p>The incomplete portions are all in the Formula class. You should be able to reuse much of your code from PS1, although some changes will be necessary. <b>This is a good chance to correct any mistakes made on PS1.</b></p>
<p>Please be aware that the specification has changed slightly and you need to be careful to catch all the changes. For example: spaces now delimit tokens, meaning x 23 is not the same as the variable "x23".</p>
<hr />
<h2>Immutable</h2>
<p>You should make sure that your formula object is immutable. In other words, there is no way to change a formula after it has been created. For example (in future spreadsheet), the only way to modify a cell with a formula in it is to build a new formula (this formula can of course be built by modifying the string representation of the previous formula).</p>
<p>Question: Does this mean the formula always evaluates to the same value?</p>
<p>Question: Does this mean that once you build the spreadsheet part of the program, you cannot change the formula in a cell?</p>
<hr />
<h2>Formula Format Exception</h2>
<p>Whenever a formula has incorrect syntax, you are to throw a FormulaFormatException. This class is provided for you. Notice that it is essentially a wrapper for the Base class Exception.</p>
<p><b> For each error condition, you should provide a meaningful warning message explaining 1) what went wrong and 2) providing a suggested possible fix. </b></p>
<p class="hint">Note: The try/catch exception handling works based on the exception type (i.e., FormulaFormatException), not the exception message. The exception message would eventually be propagated through the system to the user to help them fix the problem.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Floating Point Numbers</h2>
<p>For this assignment, we will be converting our integer math into floating point math. This should not require major changes in your code, but as always, think through the implications (e.g., how will you handle E notation 5e-5? how will you handle precision: 0.0000000000000000000001).</p>
<hr />
<h2>Equality</h2>
<p>Two Formulas are considered equal if they contain the same tokens in the same order. Remember that white space is ignored. Thus, make sure your code can determine that 2.0 == 2.000 or that X + Y is the same as X+Y.</p>
<p>Question: How are you storing your formula and thus how can you compare two formulas to see if they are the same?</p>
<hr />
<h2>Syntax and Syntax Errors</h2>
<p>The Formula constructor should throw an exception if the formula being parsed is syntactically incorrect.</p>
<p>Below we discuss parsing and some possible ways to detect syntactic errors. In each case an appropriate exception and message should be created:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Parsing</h3>
<p>We have provided a private method that will convert an input string into tokens. Verify that the only tokens are (, ), +, -, *, /, variables, and floating-point numbers.</p>
<p>Question: What are some "boundary case" for floating point numbers?</p>
<p>Question: can you explain why the GetTokens method uses the yield syntax? Related to this: what does a return type of IEnumerable mean?</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>One Token Rule</h3>
<p>There must be at least one token.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Right Parentheses Rule</h3>
<p>When reading tokens from left to right, at no point should the number of closing parentheses seen so far be greater than the number of opening parentheses seen so far.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Balanced Parentheses Rule</h3>
<p>The total number of opening parentheses must equal the total number of closing parentheses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Starting Token Rule</h3>
<p>The first token of an expression must be a number, a variable, or an opening parenthesis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Ending Token Rule</h3>
<p>The last token of an expression must be a number, a variable, or a closing parenthesis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Parenthesis Following Rule</h3>
<p>Any token that immediately follows an opening parenthesis or an operator must be either a number, a variable, or an opening parenthesis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Extra Following Rule</h3>
<p>Any token that immediately follows a number, a variable, or a closing parenthesis must be either an operator or a closing parenthesis.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Pre-Evaluation of Formula</h2>
<p>There are two stages at which you "use" a Formula object. (1) When you create the initial object, and (2) when you evaluate the current status of the object.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Construction of a Formula object</h3>
<p>At this point, any syntactically incorrect formula should be flagged via the exception process. An "invariant" will then be set saying that any formula object (that survived the original checks) is always a valid formula.</p>
<p>Note: a valid formula can still result in an invalid result, e.g., X / Y</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Evaluation of the current value of the Formula object</h3>
<p>The Evaluate method should use the evaluation algorithm from PS 1, <b>modified to deal with doubles instead of integers</b> and to take account of the normalization delegate.</p>
<p>Because the constructor throws an exception when it encounters a syntactically incorrect formula, the only problems that the Evaluate method needs to worry about are undefined variables and division by zero.</p>
</li>
</ol><hr />
<h2>Delegates</h2>
<p>For this assignment the "outside world" (i.e., the code that will be using the formula) can optionally provide two pieces of information at formula construction time (i.e., a normalizer and a validator) and one piece of information at evaluation time (i.e, a lookup function).</p>
<p><b>The lookup function</b>. The variable lookup function serves the same purpose as before and is provided at Evaluation time.</p>
<h3>Normalization</h3>
<p>Normalization is a way of putting information into a common form. For example:</p>
<p>In Excel: the cell A1 can be referred to as A1 or a1 (Excel automagically coverts all lower case cell names to upper case). In C# programming: variables can be written as: student_list or StudentList (Visual Studio does not automagically make this transformation, but it could...). In order to allow this flexibility to the user of our eventual spreadsheet, we will allow the creator of a Formula object to provide a function which converts variables to a "canonical" form (this means: to a standard form). One easy "normalizer" function would be a method that lower cases all letters in a variable name</p>
<p>Thus: (1) before/during the syntactic check on the original formula, you should normalize all variable names. (2) The associated lookup function should expect variable names to be passed in using their normalized form. Thus if the expression was A1 + B1, and the normalizer was "lowercase( var )", then the lookup function should store the keys: a1, and b1.</p>
<h3>Variable Name Validation</h3>
<p><b>The Validator</b>. The isValid function represents the application's rules for what a valid variable name is. For example, linked_list might be a valid variable in C#, but it would not be a valid variable in Excel. Rather than have the Formula class be the arbitrator of what is a valid variable names (and thus having to define valid variable names for <b>all possible uses</b>), we allow the user of our Formula object to provide a function expressing this information.</p>
<p>Note: if no normalizer and/or validator is provided, then you are to use the identify function ( s → s) for the normalizer and ( s → true ) for the validator. In other words, a1 and A1 would be different variables, and any letter followed by any number of letters, digits, and/or underscores would form valid variable names.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Part of this assignment is to develop a rich set of tests that can discover a wide range of errors in anyone's (and of course: your) implementation of the formula object. We will be grading your tests as part of the total score for this assignment.</p>
<p>You are to add a test project called FormulaTester to your PS3 solution. It should contain a good set of black-box unit tests that <b>achieve (very close to) 100% code coverage</b> for the source file Formula.cs.</p>
<p><b>Naming</b>: Name your unit tests with a descriptive title. <b>Additionally:</b> all tests that deal with the public methods, properties, etc., of the class should be placed at the top of your testing file and have a method name that starts with "public" (e.g., public_test_unknown_variable). Any test that is used to test private members of the class should have a name starting with "private" (e.g., private_test_string_rep).</p>
<p><b>Commenting</b>: Remember, each test should be designed to "break" a specific property of the implementation. You should name and comment your tests to make it explicit what their purpose is. If your test is "tricky" you should especially document what it is attempting to do.</p>
<p><b>Private Test Placement</b>. Please put all the public tests at the top of your file and all the private tests at the bottom. We will be taking your public unit tests and running them against buggy versions of our completed version of Formula.cs to see if your tests can detect our errors. (Do this we will have to delete your private tests.) Note: If your public tests assume anything else about the classes in Formula.cs, we will not be able to run them and they will not detect any errors.</p>
<p>Question: why are we only going to use your public test cases on our code and not your private test cases.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Individual and Original Work</h2>
<p>Once again, this is an individual assignment. You can work in proximity to your peers and talk through the pluses and minuses of various implementations, but when working on the computer the work should be your own. You can also discuss broad testing strategies and ways to achieve better and more comprehensive testing. Ideas discussed with others should be implemented on your own.</p>
<p>As always, while old solutions or testing suites may exist "out there", you are required to create new solutions and new tests via your own mental power. Use of old solutions (even as "study guides") not only violates course policy, but reduces your own ability to learn. When you are having problems, talk to the TAs, bring questions to class, and discuss high level solutions with your peers.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Submitting</h2>
<p>As always, as you work you must continually commit to your repository. Before the due date, you should have all of your working code checked in. We will retrieve your code by "pulling" the current version of your GitHub repository some time on Friday.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Some Hints and Thoughts</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Equality is determined by making sure each token in formula one is the same as that in formula two. You should consider the documentation of the toString function and how this might make your life a lot easier...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some boundary cases for numbers/doubles might be 0, the largest possible number, infinity, NAN, negative numbers, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IEnumerable returns a data type that can be iterated over (e.g., using the foreach loop). Yield "saves" the current computation to be "reactivated" as necessary at a future point. Note: when using a foreach loop, the "reactivation" would be at the start of each iteration of the loop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test cases that check private methods and/or private variables in a class are specific to a given implementation. Test cases that test the results of public methods/contents of public member variables (if any) are useful in evaluating the generic API of the class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Immutable objects (such as strings) are "static" once created. This ensures many nice properties about them, for example if you were to lower case a string upon creation (in the constructor) you would know that the string could never contain capital letters, and thus the toLower method could just return the current string. (Note: I'm not suggesting you would really do this.)</p>
<p>By making our formula immutable, we can ensure certain properties about it, not the least of is: if it is syntactically correct upon creation it will always be syntactically correct.</p>
<p>Finally, while we cannot change a formula once it has been "newed", we can always replace the contents of a variable with a new formula.</p>
</li>
