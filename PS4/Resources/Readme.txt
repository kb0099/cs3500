PS4 Implementation

Initial Thoughts/Concerns: First of all, when deriving the 
class Spreadsheet from AbstractSpreadsheet, eventhough the XML
comments are present on the parent class, derived class still 
needed to repeat the XML comments. In fact, it has been found 
that there exist certain external tools which can create XML 
comments for derived class based upon the parent class. In fact,
it is indicated that Java has built in symantics for comment
inheritance. However, in C# tools like GhostDoc and SandCastle 
can do the same job!

In this small project, however, repeating the comments on the base
and derived classes should not have a must negative impact.

Your name and the date associated with your comments
your initial design thoughts about the project (how you are going to set things up/code the project)
a comment on which versions of the PS2/PS3 libraries you are building against
Any notes you want the graders to be aware of when evaluating your work
The graders will look to make sure you have something interesting to say.
